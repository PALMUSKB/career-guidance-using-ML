#Career Guidance System using Machine Learning For student
Abstract - In todayâ€™s world choosing the right career is the
toughest decision. Today many students are confused about
their future. They do possess some skills but they are not able
to identify their abilities and a proper domain. Different people
suggest different career options but at last, the student has to
select their career. In this project, we have focused on this
problem of the student using machine learning. With the help
of machine learning, we will help the student to decide which
is the best career option and domain for them using different
machine learning techniques. The career is decided based on
some personal and academic information filled by the student.
This project will help the student to get directed towards a
specific domain as per their skills.
Key Words: Machine Learning, Naive Bayes, Django,
